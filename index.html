            <!--FAQ 1-->
            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
                What is a hackathon?
            </div>
            
            <div class="answer">
                We at NPHacks like to believe that a hack-a-thon is very much like an invent-a-thon where like-minded individuals with various backgrounds and skill sets come together for a weekend to “invent” something from the ground up. The only thing limiting what you build is your creativity — we’ll provide the rest.
            </div>

                You can build whatever you dream of, whether that be a website with an amazing feature, a phone app, or a prototype! Our only rule is that all code and prototypes must be written and made during the hackathon itself. Feel free to use open-source libraries and APIs; companies attending may provide their own as well. Impress us!
